## Web Servers:
Web server is used to store and deliver website content. Refers to both hardware and software. On hardware side, web server is a computer that stores web server software and website's component files such as HTML docs, images, JS and CSS. It connects to the Internet and support physical data interchange with other devices. On software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files, having at least a single HTTP server whhich understands URLs and HTTP protocol. 

Web servers are used to serve Web pages requested by clients i.e tool responsible for server-client communication through HTTP protocol. Biggest challenge is to serve many web users requesting different pages written in different programming languages. Web Servers turn files into static HTML and serve them in browser. 

How web server works:
1. Client specifies URL in web browser.
2. Web browser translates URL using DNS to obtain IP address which brings browser to web server.
3. Browser asks for particular file by sending HTTP request. 
4. Web server accepts and responds by sending requested page to browser through HTTP.
5. Browser displays webpage.

To publish a website, need either static or dynamic web server. Static web server consists of computer (hardware) and HTTP server (software). Dynamic web server consists of both static web server plus extra software such as an application server and database. 

Popular web server software include Nginx, Tomcat and Apache.


## Apache:
Most commonly used web server on Linux systems.  Apache Web Servers are often used in combination with MySQL database engine, PHP, Python and Perl (configuration is termed LAMP).
