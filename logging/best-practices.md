## Using JSON Logging

Logging in JSON transforms logs from raw text lines to a database of structured fields that you can search, filter and analyze. Moreover, we can have a richer picture of information about errors. can be easily indexed and searchable by logging infrastructure including ELK, EFK, AWS Cloudwatch, GCP Stackdriver, etc.

For Python, consider using python-json-logger.
