### Reflection

Ability of program to instropect and analyze its structure during run-time. Reflection is primarily carried out with types.

Sometimes you want to work with variables at run-time using information that didn't exist when program was written i.e. mapping data from a file or network request into a variable, or building a tool that works with different types. Reflection allows you to examine, modify and create variables, functions and structs at run-time.
