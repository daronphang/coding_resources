## Images:
Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Container images become containers at runtime. Not a complete OS i.e. no kernel, drivers, etc.

```
docker pull nginx                   Download latest version
docker pull nginx1.11
```
