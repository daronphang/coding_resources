## Microservice:
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services (compared to traditional monolithic approach) that are:
- Highly maintainable and testable.
- Loosely coupled (one team's changes won't break entire app).
- Independently deployable to meet changing business needs.
- Organized around business capabiilities.
- Owned by a small team.

This approach  values granularity, being lightweight and ability to share similar process across multiple apps. Similar to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), an established style of software design.
