## Web Servers:
Can refer to both hardware or software. On hardware side, web server is a computer that stores web server software and website's component files such as HTML docs, JS and CSS. It connects to the Internet and support physical data interchange with other devices. On software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. 

Web servers are used to serve Web pages requested by clients i.e tool responsible for storing website files and server-client communication through HTTP protocol. Biggest challenge is to serve many web users requesting different pages written in different programming languages. Web Servers turn files into static HTML and serve them in browser. When a client loads a page, the browser will send a HTTP request to web server; web server will accept the request, find the document and return a response with all the requested files including text, images, etc. 

To publish a website, need either static or dynamic web server. Static web server consists of computer (hardware) and HTTP server (software). Dynamic web server consists of both static web server plus extra software such as an application server and database. 

Popular Web Servers include Nginx, Tomcat and Apache.


## Apache:
Most commonly used web server on Linux systems.  Apache Web Servers are often used in combination with MySQL database engine, PHP, Python and Perl (configuration is termed LAMP).
