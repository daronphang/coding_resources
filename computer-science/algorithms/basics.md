### Algorithms

An algorithm for a particular task can be defined as a finite sequence of instructions, each of which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite length of time.

### Fundamentals

Given an algorithm to solve a problem, the three key aspects are:

1. Specification: What is it supposed to do?
2. Verification: Does it really do what it is supposed to do?
3. Performance Analysis: How efficiently does it do it?

For many problems, the ability to formulate an efficient algorithm depends on being able to organize data in an appropriate manner.
