## Async/Await:
Await is synthetic sugar for promises. Makes asynchronous code look like synchronous code and hence, easier to understand. Await keyword is used in an async function
to ensure all promises returned in the async function are synchronized. Await eliminates the use of callbacks in .then() and .catch() functions. Try and catch are used to get rejection
value of an async function.
