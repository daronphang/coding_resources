## Super Classes:
For multiple inheritance whereby both classes have same method name, Method Resolution Order (MRO) algorithm comes into play which decides where Python will look for a given method, and which method will be called when there's a conflict. Order is child class, followed by left to right.  

```python
class Mammal(object):
  def __init__(self, mammalName):
    print(mammalName, 'is a warm-blooded animal.')
    
class Dog(Mammal):
  def __init__(self):
    print('Dog has four legs.')
    super().__init__('Dog')
    
d1 = Dog()
```

```python
class Root:
    def draw(self):
        assert not hasattr(super(), 'draw')

class Shape(Root):
    def __init__(self, shapename, **kwds):
        self.shapename = shapename
        super().__init__(**kwds)
    def draw(self):
        print('Drawing.  Setting shape to:', self.shapename)
        super().draw()

class ColoredShape(Shape):
    def __init__(self, color, **kwds):
        self.color = color
        super().__init__(**kwds)
    def draw(self):
        print('Drawing.  Setting color to:', self.color)
        super().draw()

cs = ColoredShape(color='blue', shapename='square')
cs.draw()

```

## Mixin:
Special kind of multiple inheritance. Not created with intention to run on its own. No limit on number of mixins that can be used to compose a new class. Useful when:
- Want to provide alot of optional features for a class.
- Want to use one particular feature in alot of different classes.

```python
from .views import View
from .models import Product, Category, Customer, Order

class SingleObjectMixin(object):
    model = None
    def get_object(self, request):
        if self.model is None:
            raise Exception("Model must be set.")
        return self.model.get(id=request.kwargs.get("id")

class ProductView(SingleObjectMixin, View):
    model = Product

class CategoryView(SingleObjectMixin, View):
    model = Category

class CustomerView(SingleObjectMixin, View):
    model = Customer

class OrderView(SingleObjectMixin, View):
    model = Order
```
