## Library vs Framework:
you call a library; framework calls you.

Library is a collection of objects/functions that performs specific, well-defined operations.

Framework embodies some abstract design with more behavior built-in. Also defines a skeleton and control flow where the code will be called by the framework when appropriately. Developers do not need to be concerned with the design, but about implementing domain specific functions.
