## useEffect Cleanup Function:
Saves applications from unwanted behaviors like memory leaks by cleaning up effects. Allows to tidy up code before component unmounts. Runs before component unmount and before execution of next scheduled effect as effects run for every render and not just once. Commonly used to cancel all subscriptions made and cancel fetch requests.
