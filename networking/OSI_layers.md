## OSI Layers:
Communication protocols are built using layers in OSI model stack. Each layer has a particular function, providing a standard service to the layer above. Top is application layer (email, text messaging, web browser, etc), next is Transport/TCP layer, Internet/IP layer, and lastly network/physical layer (ethernet, WIFI, optic fibre, etc).
