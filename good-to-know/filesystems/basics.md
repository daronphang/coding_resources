### Filesystem

A file system defines how files are named, stored and retrieved from a storage device. Everytime a file is opened/downloaded/copied/edited/deleted, OS uses its file system internally to load it from storage device. File system handles space management, metadata, data encryption, file access control, and data integrity.
