## About Myself

- Previously graduated from chemical engineering at NTU but decided to expose myself to Semiconductor industry as it is more tech-focused.
- 3 years forward, have been working as a process engineer in Diffusion and rotated between different processes.
- Main job scope is to drive cost, yield and capacity improvement projects while troubleshooting adhoc manufacturing issues.
- Ideas are brainstormed together with vendors and equipment owners, performing SWR experiments, and analyzing the results through statistical plots and wafer profiling.
- ISSG reclaim wafers qualification, 27 nit dep coating recipe optimization and detection.
- Started my coding journey as the RPA rep handling adhoc requests for my module that involved heavy-manual and repetitive touches.
- Developed strong interest and pursued more in-depth knowledge about programming learning different languages, fundamentals, design patterns, architecture styles, and networking.
- Joined PEE coding team in Jan 2021 and developed MyAssistant platform for both frontend and backend (migration from monolithic to microservices).
- Overall, am looking forward to putting to practice all the things I have learned for the benefit of others.

## Why Did You Apply?

- For the first 2 years, I enjoyed working as a process engineer.
- Learning new things everyday, challenging projects, analyzing data and coming up with trends/correlations gave me satisfaction.
- However, felt that my learning has plateaued and didnt find the current role as challenging as it was previously.
- Moroever, one thing that limited my learning is maturity of process.
- Then came the opportunities to do some coding work such as RPA and for MyAssistant.
- Realized that coding is a field that not only is constantly challenging, but also strives you to think not just of solutions but optimized, looking at different interactions of components and how they come together as one, and the countless of things you could do with it.
- On top of that, you can get all of the open-source resources online.
- Since then, I have been deep diving into online courses, reading books, practicing, to prepare myself for the next embarkment in this role.

## Strengths

### Meticulous and detail-oriented

- Creating recipes and alarm conditions are tasks that requires paying attention to detail.
- Small errors may cascade into bigger problems.
- Changes are made as new technodes are introduced, need to understand if things make sense.
- Everything needs to be reviewed thoroughly before releasing for production.
- Favor quality of work over meeting deadlines strictly.

### Proactive and discplined

- If tasked with something new, I always take initiative to enroll in courses, read up and understand it before performing any work.
- Also take initiative to upgrade skills or acquire relevant knowledge.
- Software is a field that is constantly changing.
- Go beyond than just accepting what something is but understanding it.
- Taking one step at a time (focused).

### Versatile

- Versatility is one of the values my boss believes and incalculated in my team.
- Change is uneasy; but without change one would never grow.
- Link with proactiveness.
- Disliked the idea of being too reliant on someone with a particular set of skills/knowledge.
- One of the crucial tasks is knowing which library/platform/framework to work with.
- Requires knowing the tradeoffs between each other and how to work with the selected.

## Weaknesses

### Focusing too much on details

- Sometimes I get too focused/wrapped up with the details that I lose sight of the bigger picture.
- May spend a lot of unnecessary time fixing/perfecting something that has lower priority.
- For instance, working on a design flaw rather than a bug that interrupts with people's work.
- End up working too hard and unable to strike a balance between work and life.
- A journey that I'm constantly working on; my colleague and I would keep each other in check and ensuring issues on Jira with highest priority are resolved ASAP.

### Lack of patience

- When working in a team, I may lack patience and sometimes end up undertaking the tasks myself.
- This happens when I feel the work done is not up to standard, or if my team is taking too long to finish.
- Since then, I try to communicate my thoughts more effectively, and occassionally checking in on my team to see if they need any help.

### Hard time saying 'yes'

- If I am assigned tasks that I feel are not worth the effort/inefficient/leads to futile results, I would challenge my boss to provide a perspective that I can agree on.
- If cannot come to a conclusion, I may end up doing the tasks for the sake of it and not putting effort and dedication.
- My bosses wanted to implement a feature that tracks the efficiency and availability of equipments.
- However, there are existing platforms that have implemented similar features (duplicated effort).
- Provide more constructive criticisms and understand more on their POVs rather than just my POVs.
