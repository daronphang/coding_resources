## SQL Database:
Uses SQL for defining and manipulating data. Requires predefined schemas to determine data structure before it can be worked on. 

## NoSQL Database:
Have dynamic schemas for unstructured data, and can be stored in many ways including column-oriented, document-oriented, graph-based or organized as KeyValue. Developed with focus on scaling, fast queries, allowing for frequent application changes. 

## SQL vs NoSQL:
- SQL databases are relational (requires object-relational mapping or ORM) while NoSQL are non-relational.
- SQL databases use sql with predefined schema while NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas.
- SQL databases have more rigid, complex, tabular schemas and require expensive vertical scaling.
- SQL has tables with rows/columns while NoSQL has document (similar to JSON), key-value pairs, wide-column, graphs.
- SQL for vertical scaling while NoSQL for horizontal.

## Examples:
SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Snowflake. NoSQL include MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, HBase and CouchDB.
