### Data Structures
Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data; they explain the relationship between data and various logical operations that can be performed on the data. 

#### Primitive & Non-Primitive
Primitive are basic data structures containing pure and simple data values and serve as building blocks for manipulating data. They include integers, float, string and boolean. Non-primitive not only store values but a collection of values in different formats. They include lists, dictionaries, tuples and sets. 

#### Stacks
Linear data structures based on the principle of First-In/Last-Out (FILO). The addition of a new element at one end is accompanied by removal of an element from the same end. Operations include push(), pop(), size(), empty() and top().

#### Queue
Linear data structures but items are stored based on First-In/First-Out principle. Item that is least recently added is removed first. Operations include enqueue (adding) and dequeue (deleting), front and rear. 

#### Tree
Non-linear data structures and consist of nodes connected by edges. One node is designated as the root node, every other node has an associated parent node, and each node can have an arbitrary number of children nodes. A binary Tree data structure is one whose elements have no more than two children.

#### Linked List
Linear data structure that has a series of data elements joined together via links. Implemented using the concept of nodes. Linked lists have an advantage over Arrays in having a dynamic size, with ease of inserting/adding elements.

#### Hashmaps/Hash Tables
Hash function generates the address or index value of the data element. Index value serves as the key to the data value.
