### All-Pairs Shortest Paths

This problem might arise in making a table of distances between all pairs of cities for a road atlas. For every pair of vertices, we wish to find the shortest (least-weight) path from u to v, where the weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its constituent edges. Typically would want the output in tabular form: the entry in u's row and v's column should be weight of a shortest path from u to v.
