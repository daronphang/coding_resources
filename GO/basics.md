## GO Project:
A compiled language. Organized into packages (similar to libraries/modules). Has a cultural agenda of radical simplicity with garbage collection, pacakge system, first-class functions (treated like any other variable), lexical scope, system call interface and immutable strings encoded in UTF-8 (can process in all languages). Language is mature, stable and guarantees backwards compatibiity.  

```GO
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello,
}
```
