### URL

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is used to uniquely identify a resource over the web. Has the following parts:
1. Protocol: Application-level protocol used by client and server i.e. HTTP, FTP, telnet.
2. Hostname: DNS domain name or IP address of the server.
3. Port: TCP port number that the server is listening for incoming requests from clients (default is TCP 80 for HTTP).
4. Path/File Names: Name and location of requested resource, under the server document base directory.
