## OOP:
Programming paradigm that relies on concept of classes and objects, structuring reusuable pieces of code blueprints (classes) which are used to create individual instances of objects. Classes can share methods and attributes.

## Python vs Javascript:
- In Python, everything is an object (every entity has some metatdata and functionality accessible by dot notation).
- In Javascript everything is an object except null, undefined, strings, numbers, boolean and symbols (primitive values).
