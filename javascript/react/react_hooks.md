Hooks:
New addition to React 16.8. APIs that provide an alternative to writing class-based components, and offers an alternative approach to state management and lifecycle methods. Hooks bring to functional 
components the things that were only able to do with classes. 

Hook rules:
1) Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function.
2) Hooks should sit at top-level of component.
3) Only call Hooks from React functional components and not from regular function.
4) Hooks can call other hooks.

```
// hooks
useState()
useEffect()
useContext()

```
