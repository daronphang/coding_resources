## Containerization:
Bundling of different applications as a way to more effectively develop, manage and deploy them across various infrastructures. Enables companies to be more agile and scalable.

## Kubernetes:
Open-source container-as-a-service (CaaS) framework that enables developers to leverage capabilities including self-monitoring, process automation, container balancing, and storage orchestration.

## OpenShift:
Cloud-based Kubernetes container platform that is considered both a containerization software and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) i.e. software product that includes components of Kubernetes container management project, but adds productivity and security features. Supports containerized infrastructure where Docker is used to create lightweight Linux-based containers and Kubernetes supports the task of orchestrating and managing containers on multiple hosts. 

Offers consistent security, built-in monitoring, centralized policy management, and compatibility with Kubernetes container workloads. Allows developers to create, test and deploy applications on the cloud. Supports Go, NodeJS, Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl and Java.

## OpenShift vs Kubernetes:
- Both manage groups of containers called clusters that contains a control plane and worker nodes.
- Both feature robust and scalable architecture that enables rapid and large-scale application development, deployment and management, and also running on Apache license. 
- Kubernetes offers more flexibility and can be installed on any platform including Azure and AWS.
- OpenShift has stricter security policies i.e. forbidden to run container as root.
- Kubernetes has larger community of developers while OpenShift is limited primarily to Red Hat Developers.
- Kubernetes lack networking solution while OpenShift offers Open vSwitch which comes in three native plug-ins.
