## Basics:
Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are proven solutions, easily reusable and expressive. They lower the size of your codebase, prevent future refactoring, and make your code easier to understand by other developers.

Design patterns can be creational, structural, behavioral, concurrency or architectural.

### Creational:
Focus on handling object creation mechanisms by controlling the creation process. A basic object creation approach in a program can lead to an added complexity. Patterns include Constructor, Factory, Prototype, Singleton, etc.

### Structural:
Concerned with object composition. They explain simple ways to assemble objects and classes into larger structures. Help to ensure that when one part of system changes, the entire structure of system does not need to do the same, keeping them flexible and efficient. Patterns include Module, Decorator, Facade, Adapter, Proxy, etc.

### Behavioral:
Patterns focus on improving communication and assignment of responsibilities between dissimilar objects in a system. Patterns include Chain of Responsibility, Command, Observer, Iterator, Strategy, Template, etc.
