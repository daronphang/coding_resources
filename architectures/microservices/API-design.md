### API Design

Good API design is important in a microservices architecture as all data exchange between services happens either through messages or API calls. APIs must be efficient to avoid creating chatty I/O. As services are designed by teams working independently, APIs must have well-defined semantics and versioning schemes so that updates don't break other services.
