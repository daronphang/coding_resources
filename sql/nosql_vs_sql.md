##SQL Database:
Uses SQL for defining and manipulating data. Requires predefined schemas to determine data structure before it can be worked on.

## NoSQL Database:
Have dynamic schemas for unstructured data, and can be stored in many ways including column-oriented, document-oriented, graph-based or organized as KeyValue.

3. SQL databases are vertically 

## Examples:
SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Snowflake. NoSQL include MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, HBase and CouchDB.
