## Ports:
Number used to uniquely identify a transaction over a network. Default for TCP port HTTP is 80, and 25 for SMTP. Can be used to provide firewall security i.e. block outsiders from accessing intranet server at port 80. Within host, port refers to the address of the service within the system i.e. IP address + port defines the address of service on that system i.e. 192.0.0.0:8000.
