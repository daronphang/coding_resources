### Service Mesh

A service mesh is a software layer that handles service-to-service communication and designed to address many of the challenges of microservices architecture. This is done by moving the responsibility away from microservices themselves and into a shared layer. The service mesh acts as a proxy that intercepts network communication between microservices in the cluster.
