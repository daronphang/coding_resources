## Basics:
React is a JS library used for building user interfaces; focus is on components (reusuable building blocks). Though react can be used to control parts of HTML pages, more common is the Single-Page-Application (SPA) approach whereby it controls the entire frontned of a web application. Server only sends one HTML page, and React takes over and controls the UI.
