Executed designed experiments and performed post-data analysis involving statistical plots and wafer profiling while working closely with Vendors, Manufacturing and Process Integration for driving cost/yield/capacity improvement projects. 
- Designed and qualified rework flows for 27/43NIT2 through collaboration with cross-module stakeholders (WET/CMP) translating into cost savings for high defect events (scrap potential eliminated).
- Qualified MAXOUT for 27NIT with 17% RPT reduction, sendfab for existing/new technodes and merged Nitride WS resulting in capacity gain.
- Enhanced boat coating maintenance recipe for 27NIT resulting in MA gain and mitigated tool downtime.
- Qualified PM extension for RTP WS by 50% resulting in 0.77h manpower savings per shift.
- Supported TIQ of 25 SPACER ALD process with strong collaboration with IQC, Planning, Supply, CH, Vendors and Manufacturing stakeholders.
- Qualified refurbished lamphead for AMAT WS with significant cost savings between 54-72%.

Performed data mining with application of technical knowledge and process judgement to develop data-oriented  preventive solutions for yield/RDA highlights.
- Resolved defect highlight for RTP with strong collaboration with vendor/manufacturing stakeholders in driving down root cause and enhancing detection capability.
- Resolved defect toggle for 45NIT while working closely with PI/counterpart resulting in 0.2% YG and increased capacity loading.

Provided guidance and developed new procedures relating to process and equipment qualifications to address day-to-day process/manufacturing deviations.
- Initiated alarm condition/abort hardening for NIT WS to better safeguard process and quality.
- Resolved RPT mismatch for RTP chambers resulting in MA gain.
- Enhanced PMON recipe for ISSG WS and mitigated slip defects occurrence. 
- Troubleshooted day-to-day deviations and identified faulty components through checks, experiments and collaboration with equipment stakeholders.

Developed MyAssistant (frontend/backend) as a consolidated platform on Omelek to facilitate automated workflows, project and tracking management for PEE.

Automated manual and tedious workflows performed on daily basis with UIPath while working with customers on continuous improvement.

Coordinated problem solving for five major deviation events with application of 8D methodology including liaison with cross-module stakeholders, identifying gaps in existing methodologies, establishing root causes and implementing effective actions to prevent recurrence.
