## Miscellaneous:

## Creating folder:

## CMD vs PowerShell:
CMD is original shell for Microsoft OS. Powershell is new shell that replaces old CMD functionality with new scripting, allowing users to automate complicated tasks with reusable scripts. PowerShell uses cmdlets which are self-contained programming objects that expose the underlying admin options inside of Windows.
