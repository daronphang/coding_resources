### Inheritance (Is-A-Relation)

Mechanism that allows us to inherit all the properties from another class. The class from which the properties and functionalities are utilized is called parent/base class. The class which inherits is called the child/derived class.

### Composition (Has-A-Relation)

Describes a class that references to one or more objects of other classes as an Instance variable. Enables creating complex types by combining objects of different classes i.e. a class Composite can contain an object of another class component.

```py
class A:
    # initialization of properties and methods

class B:
    obj_A = A()
    # initialization of properties and methods of class B
```

```py
class Salary:
    def __init__(self, monthly_income):
        self.monthly_income = monthly_income

    def get_total(self):
        return (self.monthly_income*12)


class Employee:
    def __init__(self, monthly_income, bonus):
        self.monthly_income = monthly_income
        self.bonus = bonus
        self.obj_salary = Salary(self.monthly_income)

    def annual_salary(self):
        return "Total: " + str(self.obj_salary.get_total() + self.bonus) + ' â‚¬'


obj_emp = Employee(2600, 500)
print(obj_emp.annual_salary())
```

### Composition vs Inheritance

- Inheritance is used when a class wants to derive the nature of parent class and then extend/modify the functionality of it.
- In Composition, the class cannot be modified or have its functionality extended.
- Composition is more flexible as it models a loosely coupled relationship.
