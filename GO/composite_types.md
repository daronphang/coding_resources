## Basics:
Arrays and structs are aggregate types whereby their values are concatenations of other values in memory. Arrays are homogeneous (all elements have same type) while structs are heterogeneous. Both are fixed size as compared to slices and maps which cater for dynamic data structures.

## Arrays:
Rarely used directly in Go as they have fixed length; instead, slices are used which can grow and shrink.
