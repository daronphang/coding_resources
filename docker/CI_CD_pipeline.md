## CI/CD Pipeline:
Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pipelines are a practice focused on improving software delivery using either a DevOps or Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) approach. A series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. Introduces monitoring and automation to improve the process of application development. Pipeline elements include:
1) Build: Stage where application is compiled.
2) Test: Stage where code is tested. 
3) Release: Stage where application is delivered to repository.
4) Deploy: Stage where code is deployed to production.
5) Validation and Compliance: Determined by needs of organization.

### Benefits:
- Developers can stay focused on writing code and monitoring the behavior of the system in production.
- QA and product stakeholders have easy access to the latest, or any, version of the system.
- Product updates are not stressful.
- Logs of all code changes, tests and deployments are available for inspection at any time.
- Rolling back to a previous version in the event of a problem is a routine push-button action.
- A fast feedback loop helps build an organizational culture of learning and responsibility.

Good CI/CD pipeline is fast, reliable and accurate.
