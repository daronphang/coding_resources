## Hook

A hook is a place/interface provided in packaged code/module that allows a programmer to insert customized programming. It is a means of executing custom code (typically implemented through callback functions) either before, after or instead of the existing code. They are a category of function that allows base code to call extension code.

### Why are hooks important?

1. Hooking allows a programmer to change the behavior of a program or to react when something happens without modifying the corresponding class.
2. Hook function helps to add new functionalities to applications.
3. Ensures the inter-communication between other processes and messages of the system.
4. Useful in situations in which a core developer wants to offer extensibility without exposing their code.
