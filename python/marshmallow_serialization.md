## Marshmallow:
Marshmallow is an object-relational mapping library which is used to convert objects to and from Python data types. Often used alongside with SQLAlchemy, an ORM that maps
database schemas to Python objects. Used for:
- Validate input data.
- Deserialize input data to app-level objects.
- Serialize app-level objects to primitive Python types.
