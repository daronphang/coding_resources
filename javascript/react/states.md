## States:
Built-in React object used to manage data about the component:
- Changes in state is triggered by user action through event handlers and re-renders/evaluates the component.
- State object is initialized in constructor and can store multiple properties.
- setState() is used to change value of state object.
- State data can be modified by its own component but not from outside (private).

## Props:
Immutable and are used to pass data between components (parent to child only).
