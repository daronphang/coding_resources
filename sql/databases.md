## Databases:
Two types, SQL-based (relational) and NoSQL-based (non-relational).

## Relational Database Management System:
Uses SQL language that offers a highly organized and structured approach to information management. 

### Advantages:
- ACID compliance: Satifies priorities that measure atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability. More ACID-compliant serves to guarantee the validity of database transactions, reduced anomalies, safeguard data integrity and create stable database systems.
- Consistency: Information will remain in structure originally created.
- Support: Easy to get support, add-on products, and integrates seamlessly with software stacks including LAMP.

### Disadvantages:
- Scalability and sharding challenges: Difficult to scale up and dividing large database into smaller parts for easier management.
- Less efficient: Slower performance than NoSQL.

### Popular SQL database engines:
- Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server.


## Non-Relational Database Management System:
Allows you to organize information in looser fashion such as email texts, customer surveys, random social media information, etc. Ability to expose to powerful business intelligence systems that will analyze data with AI algorithms for machine learning. Can also structure data later and works with JSON format. 

### Advantages:
- Excellent for handling 'big data' analytics: Support speed and efficiency of server operations while offering capacity to work with large data.
- Flexibility in data types: Provides unlimited freedom to store diverse data types in same place.
- Easier to scale: Fragmented design allows it to scale up easily. 
- No data preparation needed: Doesn't require time to design a complex database model. 

### Disadvantages:
- Difficult to find support: Harder to find support from community during troubleshooting.
- Lack of tools: Have lesser third-party tools compared to SQL-based. 
- Compatibility and standardization challenges: Lack high degree of compatibility and standardization.
